# Prismarine Shard
The Prismarine Shard (just known as Shard) is a daemon that runs to manage Instances. 
It is responsible for creating, managing, running, stopping, and deleting the Docker containers that the Instances run 
within but also for facilitating communication between the Monument and the Instances.

It is built on a fork of the amazing [Pterodactyl's Wings](https://github.com/pterodactyl/wings/tree/develop)
